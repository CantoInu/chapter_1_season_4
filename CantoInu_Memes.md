## Canto Online Hackathon | Chapter 1, Season 4 | Canto Inu Meme Contest

Canto Inu announced that I would collect meme entries to suppport greater awareness of Canto through Canto's original meme token. Participants had to include elements of AI in their entries. I received a ton of recycled memes from people that photoshop logos into the same images/videos, frankly they were awful, at one point I needed drink and a Tylenol, I even had to blocked people who sent them repeatedly. 

Saving you from that, I looked through all our Twitter notifications and included everything we could find that was accepted, and have short listed 5 entries that I thought fit the theme of "Canto Inu awareness = Canto awareness". 

The deal is that the COH judges pick a winner from the 5 shortlisted entries, and if this Hackathon project submission wins anything at all, CantoInu will give all of it to the creator of the meme selected by the COH judges. CantoInu doesn't keep any prize money. So 1) pick a winner, 2) pick this submission at the winner for the Ecosystem Support category or the "all things weird" category.
